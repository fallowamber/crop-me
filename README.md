## Inspiration

In _January 2002_, a URL shortener called "**TinyURL**" was created by an _American web developer_, **Kevin Gilbertson**. Many thanks to him, as trimming of links has been possible over the recent decades with newer and better evolutions coming up, such as **bit.ly** and **goo.gl**. Although, these technologies are great, the time wasted in opening up a new tab to shorten a link in bit.ly, for example, is evitable with a recent project, titled "**Tiny Me**" - one inspired by the first ever to be made URL shortener.

## What it does

**Tiny Me**, as displayed in the [wireframe](https://www.figma.com/proto/vqzp7OhBdCwY2orfExE60S/Tiny-Me-Chrome-Extension?node-id=0%3A1&scaling=scale-down) made on Figma, is a small extension when once added to the Google Chrome Browser and is clicked on from the extension drop-down menu, shortens whatever link that was displayed in the search box.

An instance is the shortening of the world's longest URL as an example in the wireframe which was shortened to tiny.me/gogoch.

## How it was built

The original designs of how the Google Chrome Application should look like were the start of the project's look. After the application had been fully designed, the page of the world's longest URL was made. The extensions section for the Tiny Me was built using the Vimeo Screen Recording Chrome Extension as a case study.

## Challenges I ran into

Although, the project was meant to be implementable, I ran into faults trying to get a free .me domain and building the project into a Chrome Extension due to my lack of JavaScript knowledge. The only solution I could come up with to solve the problem of submitting the project earlier was to make a UI/UX design.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I'm proud of being able to come up with a grand idea like Tiny Me and finish it up but not too happy with the fact that it isn't usable, yet.

## What I learned

I learned about:

1) the world's longest URL which I absolutely thought never existed,

2) the different icons that are used in the Google Chrome Application and how to create them partially,

3) URL shorteners and their evolutions.

## What's next for Tiny Me

Definitely being implementable! It'd be an honour to see people using it in shortening links.

Also, sharing buttons would be available to social media platforms or emails. And, a technology that can predict what link title would suit the purpose. (For example, if a link involves sewing lessons and classes, Tiny Me would shorten the link in such a way as to suit the sewing classes purpose - maybe, a tiny.me/join-sewing URL would be generated).

Finally, a decorative advertisement of links to invite more viewers. Users would be able to subscribe, through payment, a way to advertise their links on the homepage of Tiny Me and possibly other advertising websites and platforms to get more analytics.
